///
/// To get information about relationships between words, we use the
/// WordNet database, which was used in the paper "Sentence similarity
/// based on semantic nets and corpus statistics" by Li, McLean, Bandar,
/// O'Shea, Crockett. Since the paper's data was already tuned to the
/// WordNet database, we decided to use the same database to get the
/// information we need, even though the original paper was more focused
/// on natural language sentences, and not on variable names.

namespace marco::codegen::lowering {
// We use the synset's hypernym.csv byte offset as the synset ID.
// Since synsets could also be defined in different ways, and one
// future implementation might use a different ID system, we use
// a typedef to make it easier to change the synset ID type.

/// @class marco::codegen::lowering::DatabaseReader
/// @brief A class that provides read access to the WordNet database.
///
/// This class encapsulates the reading of the WordNet database files,
/// which consist of three CSV files: senses.csv, hypernyms.csv, and
/// synsets.csv. These files map words to synsets, synsets to hypernyms,
/// and synsets to string names, respectively. A synset is a set of words
/// that are synonymous, and a hypernym is a word that is more general
/// than another word. For example, "language" is a hypernym of "modelica".
/// These mappings are used by @ref
/// marco::codegen::lowering::WordDistanceCalculator to calculate the distance
/// between two words. The wordnet files also contain a special 'count.txt'
/// file, which contains the total number of synset appearances in the corpus.
/// This is used to calculate the prior probability of a synset's appearance in
/// the corpus, in the
/// @ref marco::codegen::lowering::SentenceDistanceCalculator class.
///
/// All csv files contain rows of columns separated by commas. The first
/// column is always the key. The key is a byte offset in the hypernyms
/// and synsets files, and a word in the senses file, as the senses file
/// maps words to synsets. In the hypernyms file, the second column is
/// the count of hypernyms for that synset. All other columns are the
/// hypernyms themselves.
