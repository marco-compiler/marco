/// @class marco::codegen::lowering::IdentifierError
/// @brief A class that represents an error due to an undefined identifier.
///
/// This class contains the information relative to an error caused by an
/// undefined identifier.
/// It stores information about which type of identifier caused the error
/// (variable, function, class/type, field), as well as the name of the
/// identifier. It also computes the identifier that is most likely to
/// be the one the user intended to write among the provided ones and
/// the built-in ones.
///
/// The most likely identifier is chosen in two steps:
/// - syntactic distance: the editDistance function is applied to all
///   provided and built-in identifiers, and the identifier with the lowest
///   distance is chosen @ref marco::codegen::lowering::EditDistance.
/// - semantic distance: the getSimilarity method of
///   SentenceDistanceCalculator is applied to the same identifiers,
///   and the identifier with the highest similarity is chosen
///   @ref marco::codegen::lowering::SentenceDistanceCalculator.
///
/// The final identifier is chosen in the following way:
/// - if the identifier chosen in the syntactic step has a distance
///   within a certain threshold, than it is used and the semantic step
///   is skipped. The reason is that syntactic errors are more common than
///   semantic ones.
/// - if instead the distance is above the threshold, and the semantic step
///   provided an identifier with a similarity different from 0, than this
///   identifier is used.
/// - if the distance is above the threshold, but the semantic step resulted
///   in no identifier with a similarity different from 0, than the syntactic
///   result is used. This may happen if the user did not install the wordnet
///   database, or if the words that form an identifier name are not present
///   in the database.
